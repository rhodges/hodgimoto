Angular JS error "Uncaught Error: [$injector:unpr] Unknown provider: $$qProvider &lt;- $$q &lt;- $animate &lt;- $compile" </li> <ul> <li> ~8:50 PM - Dependency issues from the <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a> install. ngAnimate and ngRoute packages needed their version to go from "^1.3.0" to "~1.2.0" in the <a href="https://github.com/rhodges/hodgimoto/blob/master/bower.json" target="_blank">bower.json file</a>. </li> </ul> <li> ~11:30 PM - Created a new controller by hand, grunt didn't find it. Used `yo angular:controller header` - grunt still didn't find it. </li> <ul> <li> ~12:30 AM - Finally got silly and moved the call to the new js file in index.html between the commented "build.js" lines and everything worked swell.

No: Process!</h3> <p>I like building things. Find a problem, engineer a solution, execute the plan, then go hunt for new problems. It's great, it's fun, and it sounds like a good plan, unless you're actually an engineer and you see what's wrong with this picture: no documentation (or iteration, reflection, or several other things that should be included in any solid plan). This site is intended to do several things, not only to give me a playground where I can show off some of my favorite solutions, but also to force me to be more disciplined in my approach and record how and why I did everything so that I don't have to ask these questions over and over again.</p> <p>For example: today is the day after thanksgiving, and to help get me away from family and on the road home at a decent hour, I dangled a carrot in front of myself:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 blog-daydream"> <p>Daydream vision:</p> <p>Tonight I will make a sweet-bunned map of Mars with a wicked layer switcher, and some cool cartography and I'll be the greatest person on the internet and NASA will try to hire me and I'll say, modestly, "thanks, but I can't desert my current employer, for their work is mighty and they need me more. But maybe we can work out a deal where you can pay them to pay me to solve the world's problems with code-science." I will learn <a href="http://openlayers.org/" target="_blank">OL3</a> and build it in that, maybe with an option to bring in some 3D effects since <a href="http://openlayers.org/ol3-cesium/examples/vectors.html" target="_blank">spinny-globes are cooler</a> than <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3757132" target="_blank">mercator</a>! The world is lucky to have me. I think of everything.</p> <p>PS: <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1246403" target="_blank">D3 SPINNY GLOBES!</a></p> </div> </div> <p>Of course, as I cursed at Black Friday traffic wanting to drive 80mph through cars going 3mph due to a bad storm and an unfortunate accident, I had some time to pick this "clearly flawless" plan apart.</p> <ul> <li>My site is just a <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman</a> generated skeleton</li> <li>Despite years of <a href="http://openlayers.org/two/" target="_blank">OL2</a> experience, I don't know how to use OL3</li> <li>Can I even get a <a href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/12/maps-from-another-world.html" target="_blank">basemap for Mars</a>?</li> <li>Can I even get a <a href="http://xkcd.com/977/" target="_blank">projection</a> of Mars that will work for web maps?</li> <li>Will I have time to also finish laundry and scoop the cat litter?</li> <li>If I build this, will I learn anything from it?</li> </ul> <p>So, I decided instead to start filling in my blog page so I'd have a place to share my lessons as the 2 hour project in my head inevitably manifested itself into the 16+ hour White Rabbit-Hydra hybrid monster that I'm almost guaranteed to turn it into (for example, since when is step 1 of making a map "start a blog"?).</p> <p>Also, note my willingness to assume <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt" target="_blank">technical debt</a> already: I could install <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a> on my server, tie my <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> site to it, drop in <a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/blogs/" target="_blank">a promising looking blog module</a> and have this problem solved for good, but that brings in two very discouraging complications:</p> <ol> <li>This makes it even less likely that I will even start the map-making process tonight.</li> <li>People will be able to respond, make fun of me, and point out examples of <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/mars/#6/12.512/-62.820/0/-600/400/0.885" target="_blank">people having done this before</a>.</li> </ol> <p> Granted, #2 is not a concern. This site is not advertised, anticipated, renowned, or even close to being worth reading. That being said, I'm now aware that every painful sentence I drag out for this first entry is not helping at all.</p> <p><b>Objective 1:</b> Get concise.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
